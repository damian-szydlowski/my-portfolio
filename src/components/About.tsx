        <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          I am a second-year Mechatronics Engineering student at McMaster University with a passion for building hands-on hardware-software systems. From robotics to full-stack web development, I’m driven by a love for problem-solving and design. Outside of code, you’ll find me hiking trails, sketching out new ideas, or exploring how things work.
